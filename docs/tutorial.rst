Tutorials
=========

We provide a collection of Jupyter notebook tutorials that provide either a complete walk-through of the application
or explanations of some important functions.

For those who are impatient, we have provided a no-brainer demo script at :doc:`demo`, which runs PyLipID with all
the analysis.

If you find mistakes or have suggestions for the tutorials, please file issues or pull requests on Github to help us
improve.
