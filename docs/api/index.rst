PyLipID is a Python library and can be used through python or ipython. See Tutorials for
examples and getting started. The API (Application Programming Interface) currently contains
the main class object `LipidInteractions` and three assisting packages.

The `pylipid.LipidInteraction` class provides functions to calculate lipid interactions and
binding sites:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   index_LipidInteraction

The ``funcs`` module provides functions for functions that do the heavy-lifting:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   index_funcs

The ``plot`` module provides functions for aiding in the scientific analysis:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   index_plots

The ``utils`` module contains other assisting functions:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   index_utils
